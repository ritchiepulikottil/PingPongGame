{"name":"Ping Pong Game (using kivy framework)","tagline":"two dimensional ping pong game using kivy framework","body":"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# PingPongGame.py using kivy framework\r\n\r\n#PingPong is a two-dimensional sports game that resembles table tennis.\r\n\r\n\r\n#It requires two players and each player controls an in-game paddle to hit the ping pong ball back and forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n#The player gains a point when the player two misses to hit the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Kivy is a free and open source Python library for developing mobile apps and\r\nother multitouch application software with a natural user interface.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# Instructions\r\n\r\n#The user would require to install the Kivy framework in his computer for this game to work. \r\n(Visit : https://kivy.org/#download)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Its better to install pygame along with kivy.\r\n(type pip install pygame @cmd)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Best stable version of python to support Kivy would be Python 3.7.1\r\n\r\n\r\n#After python and kivy are configured successfully, download all the files inside this repository \r\n(Note : \"FinalCleanCode.py\" is the final code, remaining files are day-day updates)\r\n\r\n\r\n#Make sure that the .py file and the .kv file are downloaded in the same folder\r\n\r\n\r\n#After completing the above instructions, simply open the .py file and the game should start automatically.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# Bugs\r\n\r\n#The velocity increases over time, hence after a while its almost impossible to control the ball\r\n\r\n#The ball might start off with a weird direction due to the values produced by RandInt function. In such cases, simply restart the .py file\r\n\r\n#Sometimes the ball is caught inside the paddle and the score increases invariably.\r\n\r\n#Hence make sure that the ball hits the surface of the paddle to avoid this bug.\r\n\r\nenjoy :) \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
