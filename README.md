# PingPongGame.py using Kivy framework


#PingPong is a two-dimensional sports game that resembles table tennis.


#It requires two players and each player controls an in-game paddle to hit the ping pong ball back and forth.


#The player gains a point when the player two misses to hit the ball.


#Kivy is a free and open source Python library for developing mobile apps and other multitouch application software with a natural user interface.

# Instructions


#The user would require to install the Kivy framework in his computer for this game to work. (Visit : https://kivy.org/#download)


#Best stable version of python to support Kivy would be Python 3.7.1


#After python and kivy are configured successfully, download all the files inside this repository (Note : "FinalCleanCode.py" is final code, remaining files are day-day updates)


#Make sure that the .py file and the .kv file are downloaded in the same folder


#After completing the above instructions, simply open the .py file and the game should start automatically.

# BUGS 


#The velocity increases over time, hence after a while its almost impossible to control the ball

#The ball might start off with a weird direction due to the values produced by RandInt function. In such cases, simply restart the .py file

#Sometimes the ball is caught inside the paddle and the score increases invariably. Hence make sure that the ball hits the surface of the paddle to avoid this bug.

Enjoy :)
